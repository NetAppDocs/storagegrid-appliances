== Install SG5860

Follow these steps to install an SG5860 appliance and any expansion shelves into a rack or cabinet.

CAUTION: Install hardware from the bottom of the rack or cabinet or rack up to prevent the equipment from tipping over.

CAUTION: Four people or a mechanized lift are required to safely move an empty SG5860.

CAUTION: To avoid damaging the hardware, never move an SG5860 if drives are installed. You must remove all drives before moving the shelf.

.Steps

. Follow the instructions for the rail kit to install the rails in your cabinet or rack.

. Prepare to move the appliance:
 .. Remove the outer packing box.

 .. If you are lifting the SG5860 by hand, attach the four handles to the sides of the chassis.
+
You remove these handles as you slide the appliance onto the rails.

. Place the back of the appliance (the end with the connectors) on the rails.

. Supporting the appliance from the bottom, slide it into the rack or cabinet.
+
Use the thumb latches to detach the handles as you slide the appliance in.

. Secure the appliance to the front of the rack by inserting two screws in the first and third holes (counting down from the top) on each side.

. Secure the appliance to the rear of the rack or cabinet with the brackets.

. Install 12 drives in each of the five drive drawers.
+
You must install all 60 drives to ensure correct operation.

 .. Put on the ESD wristband, and remove the drives from their packaging.
 .. Release the levers on the top drive drawer, and slide the drawer out using the levers.
 .. Raise the drive handle to vertical, and align the buttons on the drive with the notches on the drawer.
