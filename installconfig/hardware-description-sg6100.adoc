[.lead]
The StorageGRID SG6100 series appliances operate as Storage Nodes in a StorageGRID system.  Like all StorageGRID appliances, they can be freely intermixed with other appliance models and software-only nodes in a single deployment. 

The StorageGRID SG6160 appliance includes a compute controller with a pair of NVMe SSDs functioning as a read cache, and a storage controller shelf that contains two storage controllers and 60 NL-SAS hard drives. It can be expanded to up to 180 NL-SAS hard drives through the addition of up to two optional expansion shelves. The StorageGRID SGF6112 appliance is an all-flash appliance with a compact 1U form factor populated with 12 NVMe SSDs.

The SGF6112 and SG6160 appliances provide the following features:

* Integrates the storage and computing elements for a StorageGRID Storage Node.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to simplify Storage Node deployment and configuration.
* Includes a baseboard management controller (BMC) for monitoring and diagnosing the hardware in the compute controller.

The SGF6112 provides the following data protection features: 

* Ability to function after the failure of a single SSD with no impact on object availability.
* Ability to function after multiple SSD failures with a minimum necessary reduction in object availability (based on the design of the underlying RAID scheme).
+
NOTE: Depending on your configured ILM policy, requests for locally unavailable objects can be serviced by other nodes, so there will usually be no reduction in availability.
* Fully recoverable, while in service, from SSD failures that don't result in extreme damage to the RAID housing the node's root volume (the StorageGRID operating system).
* Object data can be restored automatically from copies or erasure coded chunks on other nodes if multiple SSD failures result in local data loss.

The SG6160 provides the following data protection features:

* Ability to function after the failure of any two hard drives (HDDs) with no impact on object availability.
* Rapid evacuation and rebuild of HDDs during failure and replacement events (when configured for DDP or DDP16 during installation), improving data durability relative to standard RAID6.
* Fully recoverable, while in service, from the failure of any two HDDs.
* Object data can be restored automatically from copies or erasure coded chunks on other nodes if multiple HDD failures result in local data loss.
