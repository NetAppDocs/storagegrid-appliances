If you encounter issues during the installation, you might find it helpful to review troubleshooting information related to hardware setup and connectivity issues.

== View boot-up codes

When you apply power to the appliance, the BMC logs a series of boot-up codes. You can view these codes on a graphical console that is connected to the BMC management port.

.Before you begin

* You know how to link:accessing-bmc-interface.html[access the BMC dashboard].
* If you want to use serial-over-LAN (SOL), you have experience using IPMI SOL console applications.

.Steps

. Select one of the following methods for viewing the boot-up codes for the appliance controller, and gather the required equipment.
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Method| Required equipment
| VGA console
| 
* VGA-capable monitor
* VGA cable

| KVM
| * RJ-45 cable

| Serial port
| 
* DB-9 serial cable
* Virtual serial terminal

| SOL
| * Virtual serial terminal
|===

. If you are using a VGA console, perform these steps:
 .. Connect a VGA-capable monitor to the VGA port on the back of the appliance.
 .. View the codes displayed on the monitor.
. If you are using BMC KVM, perform these steps:
 .. Connect to the BMC management port and log in to the BMC web interface.
 .. Select *Remote Control*.
 .. Launch the KVM.
 .. View the codes on the virtual monitor.
. If you are using a serial port and terminal, perform these steps:
 .. Connect to the serial USB port on the back of the appliance.
 .. Use settings `115200 8-N-1`.
 .. View the codes printed over the serial terminal.
. If you are using SOL, perform these steps:
 .. Connect to the IPMI SOL using the BMC IP address and login credentials.
+
`ipmitool -I lanplus -H _BMC_Port_IP_ -U root -P _Password_ sol activate`

.. View the codes on the virtual serial terminal.

. Use the table to look up the codes for your appliance.
+
[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Code| Indicates

| HI
| The master boot script has started.

| HP
| The system is checking to see if the network interface card (NIC) firmware needs to be updated.

| RB
| The system is rebooting after applying firmware updates.

| FP
| The hardware subsystem firmware update checks have been completed. Inter-controller communication services are starting.

| HE
|
For an appliance Storage Node only:

The system is awaiting connectivity with the storage controllers and synchronizing with the SANtricity operating system.

*Note*: If the boot-up procedure does not progress past this stage, perform these steps:

.. Confirm that the four interconnect cables between the SG6100-CN controller and the two storage controllers are securely connected.
.. As required, replace one or more of the cables, and try again.
.. If this does not resolve the issue, contact technical support.

| HC
| The system is checking for existing StorageGRID installation data.

| HO
| The StorageGRID appliance is running.

| HA
| StorageGRID is running.

== View error codes

If a hardware error occurs when the appliance is booting up, the BMC logs an error code. As required, you can view these error codes using the BMC interface, and then work with technical support to resolve the issue.

.Before you begin

* You know how to link:accessing-bmc-interface.html[access the BMC dashboard].

.Steps

. From the BMC dashboard, select *BIOS POST Code*.
. Review the information displayed for Current Code and the Previous Code.

If any of the following error codes are shown, work with technical support to resolve the issue.

[[hardware-setup-hangs]]
== Hardware setup appears to hang

The StorageGRID Appliance Installer might not be available if hardware faults or cabling errors prevent the appliance from completing its boot-up processing.

.Steps

. Review the LEDs on the appliance and/or the boot-up and error codes displayed in the BMC.
. If you need help resolving an issue, contact technical support.

== Connection issues

=== Expansion shelves don't appear in Appliance Installer

If you have installed expansion shelves and they don't appear in the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, you should verify that the shelves have been completely installed and powered on.

.About this task

You can verify that the expansion shelves are connected to the appliance by viewing the following information in the StorageGRID Appliance Installer:

* The *Home* page contains a message about expansion shelves.
+
image::../media/expansion_shelf_home_page_msg.png[Expansion Shelves Msg]

* The *Advanced* > *RAID Mode* page indicates by number of drives whether or not the appliance includes expansion shelves.

If the StorageGRID Appliance Installer pages don't indicate that expansion shelves are present, follow this procedure.

.Steps

. Verify that all required cables have been firmly connected. See link:cabling-appliance.html[Cable appliance].
. Verify that you have powered on the expansion shelves. See link:connecting-power-cords-and-applying-power.html[Connect power cords and apply power (SG6100)].
. If you need help resolving an issue, contact technical support.


=== Unable to connect to appliance

If you can't connect to the storage appliance, there might be a network issue, or the hardware installation might not have been completed successfully.

.Steps

. Try to ping the appliance using the IP address for the appliance : +
+
SGF6112: `*ping _appliance/controller_IP_*`

. If you receive no response from the ping, confirm you are using the correct IP address.
+
You can use the IP address of the appliance on the Grid Network, the Admin Network, or the Client Network.

. If the IP address is correct, check appliance cabling, QSFP or SFP transceivers, and the network setup.

. If physical access to the appliance is available, you can use a direct connection to the permanent link-local IP `169.254.0.1` to check controller networking configuration and update if necessary. For detailed instructions, see step 2 in link:accessing-storagegrid-appliance-installer.html[Access StorageGRID Appliance Installer].
+
If that does not resolve the issue, contact technical support.

. If the ping was successful, open a web browser.
. Enter the URL for the StorageGRID Appliance Installer or SANtricity System Manager: +
`*https://_appliances_controller_IP_:8443*`
+
The Home page appears.
