. Decide where you are going to install the appliance.
+
CAUTION: When installing the E2860 controller shelf or optional expansion shelves, install hardware from the bottom to the top of the rack or cabinet to prevent the equipment from tipping over. To ensure that the heaviest equipment is at the bottom of the cabinet or rack, install the SG6000-CN controller above the E2860 controller shelf and expansion shelves.
+
NOTE: Before committing to the installation, verify that the 0.5m optic cables shipped with an SG6000 appliance, or cables that you supply, are long enough for the planned layout.

. Install any required network switches. See the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] for compatibility information.
