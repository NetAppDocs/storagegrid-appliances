[.lead]
The StorageGRID SG6060 and SG6060X appliances each include a compute controller and a storage controller shelf that contains two storage controllers and 60 drives. 

Optionally, 60-drive expansion shelves can be added to both appliances. There are no specification or functional differences between the SG6060 and SG6060X except for the location of the interconnect ports on the storage controller.

== SG6060 and SG6060X components

The SG6060 and SG6060X appliances include the following components:

Compute controller::
The SG6000-CN controller is a one-rack unit (1U) server that includes:
+
* 40 cores (80 threads)
* 192 GB RAM
* Up to 4 × 25 Gbps aggregate Ethernet bandwidth
* 4 × 16 Gbps Fibre Channel (FC) interconnect
* Baseboard management controller (BMC) that simplifies hardware management
* Redundant power supplies

Storage controller shelf::
The E-Series E2860 controller shelf (storage array) is a 4U shelf that includes:
+
* Two E2800 series controllers (duplex configuration) to provide storage controller failover support
** The SG6060 contains E2800A storage controllers
** The SG6060X contains E2800B storage controllers
* Five-drawer drive shelf that holds sixty 3.5-inch drives (2 solid-state drives, or SSDs, and 58 NL-SAS drives)
* Redundant power supplies and fans

Optional: Storage expansion shelves::
Each SG6060 and SG6060X appliance can have one or two expansion shelves for a total of 180 drives (two of these drives are reserved for E-Series read cache).
+
*Note:* Expansion shelves can be installed during initial deployment or added later.
+
The E-Series DE460C enclosure is a 4U shelf that includes:
+
* Two input/output modules (IOMs)
* Five drawers, each holding 12 NL-SAS drives, for a total of 60 drives
* Redundant power supplies and fans

== SG6060 and SG6060X diagrams
The fronts of the SG6060 and SG6060X are identical.

== SG6000 controllers

Each model of the StorageGRID SG6000 appliance includes an SG6000-CN compute controller in a 1U enclosure and duplex E-Series storage controllers in a 2U or 4U enclosure, depending on the model. Review the diagrams to learn more about each type of controller.

=== SG6000-CN compute controller

* Provides compute resources for the appliance.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
+
NOTE: StorageGRID software is not preinstalled on the appliance. This software is retrieved from the Admin Node when you deploy the appliance.

* Can connect to all three StorageGRID networks, including the Grid Network, the Admin Network, and the Client Network.
* Connects to the E-Series storage controllers and operates as the initiator.
