| Callout | Port| Type of port| Use

|1
|BMC management port on the appliance
|1-GbE (RJ-45)
|Connects to the network where you access the BMC interface.

|2
|Four network ports on the SG6100-CN controller
|* Four 10/25-GbE network ports on the appliance 
* Four 10/25/40/100-GbE network ports with optional 100G NIC SKU (SG6160 only)
|Connect to the Grid Network and the Client Network for StorageGRID. See link:gathering-installation-information-sg6100.html#port-bond-modes[Port bond modes (SG6100)]

|3
|Admin Network port on the appliance (labeled P1 in the figure)
|1/10-GbE (RJ-45)

*Important:* This port operates only at 1/10-GbE (RJ-45) and does not support 100-megabit speeds.
|Connects the appliance to the Admin Network for StorageGRID.

|
|Rightmost RJ-45 port on the appliance
|1/10-GbE (RJ-45)

*Caution:* This port operates only at 1/10-GbE (RJ-45) and does not support 100-megabit speeds.
|
* Can be bonded with management port 1 if you want a redundant connection to the Admin Network.
* Can be left disconnected and available for temporary local access (IP 169.254.0.1).
* During installation, can be used to connect the appliance to a service laptop if DHCP-assigned IP addresses aren't available.

|4 (SG6160 only)
|Five total connection ports
|
* One 100GbE port on the SG6100-CN
* Two 10/25GbE ports on each of the storage controllers
|Connect each storage controller to the SG6100-CN controller.

|5 (SG6160 only)
|Management port 1 on each storage controller
|1-GbE (RJ-45)
|Connects to the network where you access SANtricity System Manager.

|
|Management port 2 on each storage controller
|1-GbE (RJ-45)
|Connects to the network where you access SANtricity System Manager.

.Steps

. Connect the BMC management port on the appliance to the management network, using an Ethernet cable.
+
Although this connection is optional, it is recommended to facilitate support.
. Connect the two interconnect ports on each storage controller to the 100GbE port on the SG6100-CN controller, using one 100-GbE QSFP28 to 4x25-GbE SFP28 cable.
. Connect the network ports on the appliance to the appropriate network switches, using TwinAx cables or optical cables and transceivers.

* Grid and Client network ports can be run at different speeds only if Autonegotiate is selected as the link speed, and Fixed is selected as the port bond mode. Otherwise, all four ports will run at the same speed.

* If you plan to use Fixed port bond mode (default), connect the ports to the StorageGRID Grid and Client Networks, as shown in the table.

|Port 1
|Client Network (optional)

|Port 2
|Grid Network

|Port 3
|Client Network (optional)

|Port 4
|Grid Network
|===

* If you plan to use the Aggregate port bond mode, connect one or more of the network ports to one or more switches. You should connect at least two of the four ports to avoid having a single point of failure. If you use more than one switch for a single LACP bond, the switches must support MLAG or equivalent.

. If you plan to use the Admin Network for StorageGRID, connect the Admin Network port on the appliance to the Admin Network, using an Ethernet cable.

. If your appliance includes an expansion shelf, see the link:../sg6100/adding-expansion-shelf-to-deployed-sg6160.html[instructions for adding an expansion shelf to a deployed SG6160] for cabling information.
