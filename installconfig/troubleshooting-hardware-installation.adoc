If you encounter issues during the installation, you might find it helpful to review troubleshooting information related to hardware setup and connectivity issues.

[[view-boot-codes]]
== View boot-up codes (SG6000-CN controller)

When you apply power to the appliance, the BMC logs a series of boot-up codes for the SG6000-CN controller. You can view these codes in several ways.

.Before you begin

* You know how to link:accessing-bmc-interface.html[access the BMC dashboard].
* If you want to use serial-over-LAN (SOL), you have experience using IPMI SOL console applications.

.Steps

. Select one of the following methods for viewing the boot-up codes for the appliance controller, and gather the required equipment.

KVM
a|

 ** RJ-45 cable

a|
Serial port
a|

 ** DB-9 serial cable
 ** Virtual serial terminal

a|

a|

 ** Virtual serial terminal
|===

. If you are using a VGA console, perform these steps:
 .. Connect a VGA-capable monitor to the VGA port on the back of the appliance.
 .. View the codes displayed on the monitor.
. If you are using BMC KVM, perform these steps:
 .. Connect to the BMC management port and log in to the BMC web interface.
 .. Select *Remote Control*.
 .. Launch the KVM.
 .. View the codes on the virtual monitor.
. If you are using a serial port and terminal, perform these steps:
 .. Connect to the DB-9 serial port on the back of the appliance.
 .. Use settings `115200 8-N-1`.
 .. View the codes printed over the serial terminal.
. If you are using SOL, perform these steps:
 .. Connect to the IPMI SOL using the BMC IP address and login credentials.
+
`ipmitool -I lanplus -H _BMC_Port_IP_ -U root -P _Password_ sol activate`

 .. View the codes on the virtual serial terminal.
. Use the table to look up the codes for your appliance.

[[error-codes]]
== View error codes (SG6000-CN controller)

If a hardware error occurs when the SG6000-CN controller is booting up, the BMC logs an error code. As required, you can view these error codes using the BMC interface, and then work with technical support to resolve the issue.

.Before you begin

* You know how to link:accessing-bmc-interface.html[access the BMC dashboard].

.Steps

. From the BMC dashboard, select *BIOS POST Code*.

[[hardware-setup-hangs]]
== Hardware setup appears to hang (SG6000 or SG5700)

The StorageGRID Appliance Installer might not be available if hardware faults or cabling errors prevent the storage controllers or the appliance controller from completing their boot-up processing.

.Steps

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.SG5700
--
. link:viewing-status-indicators.html[Watch the codes on the SG5700 seven-segment displays.]
+
While the hardware is initializing during power up, the two seven-segment displays show a sequence of codes. When the hardware boots successfully, the seven-segment displays show different codes for each controller.

. Review the codes on the seven-segment display for the E5700SG controller.
+
NOTE: The installation and provisioning take time. Some installation phases don't report updates to the StorageGRID Appliance Installer for several minutes.
+
If an error occurs, the seven-segment display flashes a sequence, such as HE.

. To understand what these codes mean, see the following resources:

. For the storage controllers, watch the codes on the seven-segment displays.
+
While the hardware is initializing during power up, the two seven-segment displays show a sequence of codes. When the hardware boots successfully, both seven-segment displays show `99`.

. Review the LEDs on the SG6000-CN controller and the boot-up and error codes displayed in the BMC.
. If you need help resolving an issue, contact technical support.

[[connection-issues]]
== Connection issues (SG5700 or SG6000)

If you encounter connection issues during the StorageGRID appliance installation, you should perform the corrective action steps listed.

=== Unable to connect to SG6000 appliance

If you can't connect to the appliance, there might be a network issue, or the hardware installation might not have been completed successfully.

.Steps

. If you are unable to connect to SANtricity System Manager:
 .. Try to ping the appliance using the IP address for either storage controller on the management network for SANtricity System Manager: +
`*ping _Storage_Controller_IP_*`
 .. If you receive no response from the ping, confirm you are using the correct IP address.
+
Use the IP address for management port 1 on either storage controller.

 .. If the IP address is correct, check appliance cabling and the network setup.
+
If that does not resolve the issue, contact technical support.

 .. If the ping was successful, open a web browser.
 .. Enter the URL for SANtricity System Manager: +
`*https://_Storage_Controller_IP_*`
+
The log in page for SANtricity System Manager appears.
. If you are unable to connect to the SG6000-CN controller:
 .. Try to ping the appliance using the IP address for the SG6000-CN controller: +
`*ping _SG6000-CN_Controller_IP_*`
 .. If you receive no response from the ping, confirm you are using the correct IP address.
+
You can use the IP address of the appliance on the Grid Network, the Admin Network, or the Client Network.

 .. If the IP address is correct, check appliance cabling, SFP transceivers, and the network setup.

 .. If physical access to the SG6000-CN is available, you can use a direct connection to the permanent link-local IP `169.254.0.1` to check controller networking configuration and update if necessary. For detailed instructions, see step 2 in link:accessing-storagegrid-appliance-installer.html[Accessing StorageGRID Appliance Installer].
+
If that does not resolve the issue, contact technical support.

 .. If the ping was successful, open a web browser.
 .. Enter the URL for the StorageGRID Appliance Installer: +
`*https://_SG6000-CN_Controller_IP_:8443*`
+
The Home page appears.

=== SG6060 expansion shelves don't appear in Appliance Installer

If you have installed expansion shelves for the SG6060 and they don't appear in the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, you should verify that the shelves have been completely installed and powered on.

.About this task

You can verify that the expansion shelves are connected to the appliance by viewing the following information in the StorageGRID Appliance Installer:

* The *Home* page contains a message about expansion shelves.
+
image::../media/expansion_shelf_home_page_msg.png[Expansion Shelves Msg]

* The *Advanced* > *RAID Mode* page indicates by number of drives whether or not the appliance includes expansion shelves. For example, in the following screen shot, two SSDs and 178 HDDs are shown. An SG6060 with two expansion shelves contains 180 total drives.

image::../media/expansion_shelves_shown_by_num_of_drives.png[Number of Drives]

If the StorageGRID Appliance Installer pages don't indicate that expansion shelves are present, follow this procedure.

.Steps

. Verify that all required cables have been firmly connected. See link:cabling-appliance.html[Cable appliance].
. Verify that you have powered on the expansion shelves. See link:connecting-power-cords-and-applying-power.html[Connect power cords and apply power (SG6000)].
. If you need help resolving an issue, contact technical support.

[[he-error]]
== HE error: Error synchronizing with SANtricity OS Software (SG5700)

The seven-segment display on the compute controller shows an HE error code if the StorageGRID Appliance Installer can't synchronize with SANtricity OS Software.

.About this task

If an HE error code is displayed, perform this corrective action.

.Steps

. Check the integrity of the two SAS interconnect cables, and confirm they are securely connected.
. As required, replace one or both of the cables, and try again.
. If this does not resolve the issue, contact technical support.
