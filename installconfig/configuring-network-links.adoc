[.lead]
You can configure network links for the ports used to connect the appliance to the Grid Network, the Client Network, and the Admin Network. You can set the link speed as well as the port and network bond modes.

TIP: If you are using ConfigBuilder to generate a JSON file, you can configure the network links automatically. See link:automating-appliance-installation-and-configuration.html[Automate appliance installation and configuration].

.Before you begin

* You have link:obtaining-additional-equipment-and-tools.html[obtained the additional equipment] required for your cable type and link speed. 
* You have installed the correct transceivers in the ports, based on the link speed you plan to use.
* You have connected the network ports to switches that support your chosen speed.

If you plan to use Aggregate port bond mode, LACP network bond mode, or VLAN tagging:

* You have connected the network ports on the appliance to switches that can support VLAN and LACP.
* If multiple switches are participating in the LACP bond, the switches support multi-chassis link aggregation groups (MLAG), or equivalent.
* You understand how to configure the switches to use VLAN, LACP, and MLAG or equivalent.
* You know the unique VLAN tag to use for each network. This VLAN tag will be added to each network packet to ensure that network traffic is routed to the correct network.

.About this task

You only need to configure the settings on the Link Configuration page if you want to use a non-default setting.

NOTE: The LACP transmit hash policy is layer2+3.

The figures and tables summarize the options for the port bond mode and network bond mode for each appliance. See the following for more information:

+
The Network Link Configuration page displays a diagram of your appliance with the network and management ports numbered.

The Link Status table lists the link state, link speed, and other statistics of the numbered ports.

//image::../media/sg1000_configuring_network_link_status.png[SG1000 Link Status]
+
The first time you access this page:

 ** *Link Speed* is set to *Auto*.
 ** *Port bond mode* is set to *Fixed*.
 ** *Network bond mode* is set to *Active-Backup* for the Grid Network.
 ** The *Admin Network* is enabled, and the network bond mode is set to *Independent*.
 ** The *Client Network* is disabled.
//+
//image::../media/sg1000_network_link_configuration_fixed.png[Network Link Configuration Fixed]
//image::../media/network_link_configuration_fixed.png[Network Link Configuration Fixed]

. Select the link speed for the network ports from the *Link speed* drop-down list.
+
The network switches you are using for the Grid Network and the Client Network must also support and be configured for this speed. You must use the appropriate adapters or transceivers for the configured link speed. Use Auto link speed when possible because this option negotiates both link speed and Forward Error Correction (FEC) mode with the link partner.
+
If you plan to use the 25-GbE link speed for the SG6000 or SG5700 network ports:

 ** Use SFP28 transceivers and SFP28 TwinAx cables or optical cables.
 ** For the SG6000, select *Auto* from the *Link speed* drop-down list.
 ** For the SG5700, select *25GbE* from the *Link speed* drop-down list.

. Enable or disable the StorageGRID networks you plan to use.
+
The Grid Network is required. You can't disable this network.

 .. If the appliance is not connected to the Admin Network, clear the *Enable network* checkbox for the Admin Network.
//+
//image::../media/admin_network_disabled.gif[Screenshot showing checkbox for enabling or disabling the Admin Network]

 .. If the appliance is connected to the Client Network, select the *Enable network* checkbox for the Client Network.
+
The Client Network settings for the data NIC ports are now shown.

. Refer to the table, and configure the port bond mode and the network bond mode.
+
This example shows:

 ** *Aggregate* and *LACP* selected for the Grid and the Client Networks. You must specify a unique VLAN tag for each network. You can select values between 0 and 4095.
 ** *Active-Backup* selected for the Admin Network.
+

. When you are satisfied with your selections, click *Save*.
+
NOTE: You might lose your connection if you made changes to the network or link you are connected through. If you aren't reconnected within 1 minute, re-enter the URL for the StorageGRID Appliance Installer using one of the other IP addresses assigned to the appliance: +
