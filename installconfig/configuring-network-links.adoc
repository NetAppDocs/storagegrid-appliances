[.lead]
You can configure network links for the ports used to connect the appliance to the Grid Network, the Client Network, and the Admin Network. You can set the link speed as well as the port and network bond modes.

TIP: If you are using ConfigBuilder to generate a JSON file, you can configure the network links automatically. See link:automating-appliance-installation-and-configuration.html[Automate appliance installation and configuration].

.Before you begin

* You have link:obtaining-additional-equipment-and-tools.html[obtained the additional equipment] required for your cable type and link speed. 
* You have installed the correct transceivers in the ports, based on the link speed you plan to use.
* You have connected the network ports to switches that support your chosen speed.

If you plan to use Aggregate port bond mode, LACP network bond mode, or VLAN tagging:

* You have connected the network ports on the appliance to switches that can support VLAN and LACP.
* If multiple switches are participating in the LACP bond, the switches support multi-chassis link aggregation groups (MLAG), or equivalent.
* You understand how to configure the switches to use VLAN, LACP, and MLAG or equivalent.
* You know the unique VLAN tag to use for each network. This VLAN tag will be added to each network packet to ensure that network traffic is routed to the correct network.

.About this task

You only need to configure the settings on the Link Configuration page if you want to use values other than the <<default_values,default settings>>.

NOTE: LACP PDU rate changes that are made following these instructions remain persistent in the StorageGRID environment. To make temporary changes to the LACP PDU rate when performing maintenance operations on network components installed in your appliance, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid/maintain/changing-nodes-network-configuration.html#temporarily-changing-the-lacp-pdu-rate[Temporarily changing the LACP PDU rate^]. 

[[port_config_tables]]The figures and tables summarize the options for the port bond mode and network bond mode for each appliance. See the following for more information:

The Network Link Configuration page displays a diagram of your appliance with the network and management ports numbered.

The Link Status table lists the link state, link speed, and other statistics of the numbered ports.

[[default_values]]The first time you access this page, the default values are:

 ** *Link Speed* is set to *Auto*.
 ** *Port bond mode* is set to *Fixed*.
 ** *LACP transmit hash policy* is set to *Layer2+3*.
 ** *LACP PDU rate*  is set to *Fast*.
 ** *Network bond mode* is set to *Active-Backup* for the Grid Network.
 ** The *Admin Network* is enabled, and the network bond mode is set to *Independent*.
 ** The *Client Network* is enabled.
//+
//image::../media/sg1000_network_link_configuration_fixed.png["Network Link Configuration Fixed"] 
//image::../media/network_link_configuration_fixed.png["Network Link Configuration Fixed"] 

. Select the link speed for the network ports from the *Link speed* drop-down list.
+
The network switches you are using for the Grid Network and the Client Network must also support and be configured for this speed. You must use the appropriate adapters or transceivers for the configured link speed. Use Auto link speed when possible because this option negotiates both link speed and Forward Error Correction (FEC) mode with the link partner.
