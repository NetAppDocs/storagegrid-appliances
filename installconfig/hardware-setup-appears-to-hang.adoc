. For the storage controllers, watch the codes on the seven-segment displays.
+
While the hardware is initializing during power up, the two seven-segment displays show a sequence of codes. When the hardware boots successfully, both seven-segment displays show `99`.

. Review the LEDs on the SG6000-CN controller and the boot-up and error codes displayed in the BMC.
. If you need help resolving an issue, contact technical support.

.SG5700
--
. Watch the codes on the seven-segment displays.
+
While the hardware is initializing during power up, the two seven-segment displays show a sequence of codes. When the hardware boots successfully, the seven-segment displays show different codes for each controller.

. Review the codes on the seven-segment display for the E5700SG controller.
+
NOTE: The installation and provisioning take time. Some installation phases don't report updates to the StorageGRID Appliance Installer for several minutes.
+
If an error occurs, the seven-segment display flashes a sequence, such as HE.

. To understand what these codes mean, see the following resources:
