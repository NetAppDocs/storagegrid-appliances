[.lead]
The SG5700 StorageGRID appliance is an integrated storage and computing platform that operates as a Storage Node in a StorageGRID grid. The appliance can be used in a hybrid grid environment that combines appliance Storage Nodes and virtual (software-based) Storage Nodes.

StorageGRID SG5700 series appliance provides the following features:

* Integrate the storage and computing elements for a StorageGRID Storage Node.
* Include the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to simplify Storage Node deployment and configuration.
* Includes E-Series SANtricity System Manager for hardware management and monitoring.
* Support up to four 10-GbE or 25-GbE connections to the StorageGRID Grid Network and Client Network.
* Support Full Disk Encryption (FDE) drives or FIPS drives. When these drives are used with the Drive Security feature in SANtricity System Manager, unauthorized access to data is prevented.

The SG5700 appliance is available in four models: the SG5712 and SG5712X, and the SG5760 and SG5760X. There are no specification or functional differences between the SG5712 and SG5712X except for the location of the interconnect ports on the storage controller. Similarly, there are no specification or functional differences between the SG5760 and SG5760X except for the location of the interconnect ports on the storage controller.

== SG5700 controllers

Both the 12-drive SG5712 and SG5712X and the 60-drive SG5760 and SG5760X models of the StorageGRID appliance include an E5700SG compute controller and an E-Series E2800 storage controller. 

* The SG5712 and SG5760 use a E2800A controller. 
* The SG5712X and the SG5760X use a E2800B controller.

The E2800A and E2800B controllers are identical in specification and function except for the location of the interconnect ports. 

=== E5700SG compute controller

* Operates as the compute server for the appliance.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
+
NOTE: StorageGRID software is not preinstalled on the appliance. This software is accessed from the Admin Node when you deploy the appliance.

* Can connect to all three StorageGRID networks, including the Grid Network, the Admin Network, and the Client Network.
* Connects to the E2800 controller and operates as the initiator.

=== E2800 storage controller

There are two versions of the E2800 storage controller used in the SG5700 appliances: E2800A and E2800B. The E2800A does not have a HIC, and the E2800B has a four-port HIC. The two controller versions have identical specifications and function except for the location of the interconnect ports. 

The E2800 series storage controller has the following specifications: 

* Operates as the storage controller for the appliance.
* Manages the storage of data on the drives.
* Functions as a standard E-Series controller in simplex mode.
* Includes SANtricity OS Software (controller firmware).
* Includes SANtricity System Manager for monitoring appliance hardware and for managing alerts, the AutoSupport feature, and the Drive Security feature.
* Connects to the E5700SG controller and operates as the target.
