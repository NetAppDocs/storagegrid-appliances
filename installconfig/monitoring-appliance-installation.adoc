+
The blue status bar indicates which task is currently in progress. Green status bars indicate tasks that have completed successfully.
+
NOTE: The installer ensures that tasks completed in a previous install aren't re-run. If you are re-running an installation, any tasks that don't need to be re-run are shown with a green status bar and a status of "`Skipped.`"

. Review the progress of the first two installation stages.
+
*1. Configure storage*
+
During this stage, the installer connects to the storage controller, clears any existing configuration, creates RAIDs according to the configured RAID Mode, allocates volumes for StorageGRID software and object data storage, and configures host settings.
+
*2. Install OS*
+
During this stage, the installer copies the base operating system image for StorageGRID to the appliance.
. Continue monitoring the installation progress until the *Install StorageGRID* stage pauses and a message appears on the embedded console, prompting you to approve this node on the Admin Node using the Grid Manager. Go to the next step.

+

. Continue monitoring the installation progress until one of the following processes occurs:
 ** For all appliance nodes except the primary Admin Node, the Install StorageGRID stage pauses and a message appears on the embedded console, prompting you to approve this node on the Admin Node using the Grid Manager. Go to the next step.
 ** For appliance primary Admin Node installation, you don't need to approve the node. The appliance is rebooted. You can skip the next step.
