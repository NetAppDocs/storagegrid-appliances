[.lead]
You can use SANtricity System Manager to monitor the status of the storage controllers, storage disks, and other hardware components in the storage controller shelf. You can also configure a proxy for E-Series AutoSupport that enables you to send AutoSupport messages from the appliance without the use of the management port.

== Set up and access SANtricity System Manager

You might need to access SANtricity System Manager on the storage controller to monitor the hardware in the storage controller shelf or to configure E-Series AutoSupport.

.Before you begin

* You are using a https://review.docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118_main/admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser^].
* To access SANtricity System Manager through Grid Manager, you have installed StorageGRID, and you have the Storage appliance administrator permission or Root access permission.
* To access SANtricity System Manager using the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, you have the SANtricity System Manager administrator username and password.
* To access SANtricity System Manager directly using a web browser, you have the SANtricity System Manager administrator username and password.

NOTE: You must have SANtricity firmware 8.70 or higher to access SANtricity System Manager using the Grid Manager or the StorageGRID Appliance Installer. You can check your firmware version by using the StorageGRID Appliance Installer and selecting *Help* > *About*.

IMPORTANT: Accessing SANtricity System Manager from the Grid Manager or from the Appliance Installer is generally meant only for monitoring your hardware and configuring E-Series AutoSupport. Many features and operations within SANtricity System Manager such as upgrading firmware don't apply to monitoring your StorageGRID appliance. To avoid issues, always follow the hardware installation and maintenance instructions for your appliance.

.About this task

There are three ways to access SANtricity System Manager, depending upon what stage of the installation and configuration process you are in:

* If the appliance has not yet been deployed as a node in your StorageGRID system, you should use the Advanced tab in the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
+
NOTE: Once the node is deployed, you can no longer use the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to access SANtricity System Manager.

* If the appliance has been deployed as a node in your StorageGRID system, use the SANtricity System Manager tab on the Nodes page in Grid Manager.
* If you can't use the StorageGRID Appliance Installer or Grid Manager, you can access SANtricity System Manager directly using a web browser connected to the management port.

This procedure includes steps for your initial access to SANtricity System Manager. If you have already set up SANtricity System Manager, go to the  <<config_hardware_alerts_sg6000,configure hardware alerts step>>.

NOTE: Using either the Grid Manager or the StorageGRID Appliance Installer enables you to access SANtricity System Manager without having to configure or connect the management port of the appliance.

You use SANtricity System Manager to monitor the following:

* Performance data such as storage array level performance, I/O latency, CPU utilization, and throughput
* Hardware component status
* Support functions including viewing diagnostic data

You can use SANtricity System Manager to configure the following settings:

* Email alerts, SNMP alerts, or syslog alerts for the components in the storage controller shelf
* E-Series AutoSupport settings for the components in the storage controller shelf.
+
For additional details on E-Series AutoSupport, see the http://mysupport.netapp.com/info/web/ECMP1658252.html[NetApp E-Series Systems Documentation Site^].

* Drive Security keys, which are needed to unlock secured drives (this step is required if the Drive Security feature is enabled)
* Administrator password for accessing SANtricity System Manager

.Steps

. Do one of the following:
 ** Use the StorageGRID Appliance Installer and select *Advanced* > *SANtricity System Manager*
 ** Use the Grid Manager and select *NODES* > `*_appliance Storage Node_*` > *SANtricity System Manager*

+
NOTE: If these options aren't available or the login page does not appear, use the <<Set IP addresses for storage controllers using StorageGRID Appliance Installer,IP addresses for the storage controllers>>. Access SANtricity System Manager by browsing to the storage controller IP.

. Set or enter the administrator password.
+
SANtricity System Manager uses a single administrator password that is shared among all users.

If the status of any component is Needs Attention, follow the steps in the Recovery Guru to resolve the issue or contact technical support.

== Set IP addresses for storage controllers using StorageGRID Appliance Installer

Management port 1 on each storage controller connects the appliance to the management network for SANtricity System Manager. If you can't access SANtricity System Manager from the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, set a static IP address for each storage controller to ensure that you don't lose your management connection to the hardware and the controller firmware in the controller shelf.

.Before you begin

* You are using any management client that can connect to the StorageGRID Admin Network, or you have a service laptop.
* The client or service laptop has a supported web browser.

.About this task

DHCP-assigned addresses can change at any time. Assign static IP addresses to the controllers to ensure consistent accessibility.

NOTE: Follow this procedure only if you don't have access to SANtricity System Manager from the StorageGRID Appliance Installer (*Advanced* > *SANtricity System Manager*) or Grid Manager (*NODES* > *SANtricity System Manager*).

.Steps

. From the client, enter the URL for the StorageGRID Appliance Installer: +
`*https://_Appliance_Controller_IP_:8443*`
+
For `_Appliance_Controller_IP_`, use the IP address for the appliance on any StorageGRID network.
+
The StorageGRID Appliance Installer Home page appears.

. Select *Configure Hardware* > *Storage Controller Network Configuration*.
+
The Storage Controller Network Configuration page appears.

. Depending on your network configuration, select *Enabled* for IPv4, IPv6, or both.
. Make a note of the IPv4 address that is automatically displayed.
+
DHCP is the default method for assigning an IP address to the storage controller management port.
+
NOTE: It might take a few minutes for the DHCP values to appear.
+
image::../media/storage_controller_network_config_ipv4.gif[Storage Controller Network Config IPv4]

. Optionally, set a static IP address for the storage controller management port.
+
NOTE: You should either assign a static IP for the management port or assign a permanent lease for the address on the DHCP server.

 .. Select *Static*.
 .. Enter the IPv4 address, using CIDR notation.
 .. Enter the default gateway.
+
image::../media/storage_controller_ipv4_and_def_gateway.gif[Storage Controller Network Config IPv4 and Default Gateway]

 .. Click *Save*.
+
It might take a few minutes for your changes to be applied.
+
When you connect to SANtricity System Manager, you will use the new static IP address as the URL: +
`*https://_Storage_Controller_IP_*`
