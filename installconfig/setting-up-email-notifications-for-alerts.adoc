If you want email notifications to be sent when alerts occur, use the BMC interface to configure SMTP settings, users, LAN destinations, alert policies, and event filters.

NOTE: BMC settings made by this procedure might not be preserved if a controller or appliance fails and has to be replaced. Make sure you have a record of all settings you have applied, so they can be easily reapplied after a hardware replacement if necessary.
