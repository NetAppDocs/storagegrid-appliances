If you are familiar with configuring SNMP for hardware, you can use the BMC interface to configure the SNMP settings for the SG6100, SG6000, and services appliances. You can provide secure community strings, enable SNMP Trap, and specify up to five SNMP destinations.

.Before you begin

* You know how to access the BMC dashboard.
* You have experience in configuring SNMP settings for SNMPv1-v2c equipment.

NOTE: BMC settings made by this procedure might not be preserved if the appliance fails and has to be replaced.  Make sure you have a record of all settings you have applied, so they can be easily reapplied after a hardware replacement if necessary.

.Steps

. From the BMC dashboard, select *Settings* > *SNMP Settings*.
. On the SNMP Settings page, select *Enable SNMP V1/V2*, and then provide a Read-Only Community String and a Read-Write Community String.
+
The Read-Only Community String is like a user ID or password. You should change this value to prevent intruders from getting information about your network setup. The Read-Write Community String protects the device against unauthorized changes.

. Optionally, select *Enable Trap*, and enter the required information.
+
NOTE: Enter the Destination IP for each SNMP trap using an IP address. Fully qualified domain names aren't supported.
+
Enable traps if you want the appliance to send immediate notifications to an SNMP console when it is in an unusual state. Depending on the device, traps might indicate hardware failures of various components, link up/down conditions, temperature thresholds being exceeded, or high traffic.

. Optionally, click *Send Test Trap* to test your settings.
. If the settings are correct, click *Save*.
