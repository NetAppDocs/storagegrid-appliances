As you install and configure a StorageGRID appliance, you make decisions and gather information about Ethernet switch ports, IP addresses, and port and network bond modes. 

Refer to the instructions for your appliance to determine what information you need:

* link:gathering-installation-information-sg6000.html[SG6000]
* link:gathering-installation-information-sg5700.html[SG5700]
* link:gathering-installation-information-sg100-and-sg1000.html[SG100 and SG1000]

Alternatively, you can work with your NetApp Professional Services consultant to use the NetApp ConfigBuilder tool to streamline and automate the configuration steps. See link:automating-appliance-installation-and-configuration.html[Automate appliance installation and configuration].
