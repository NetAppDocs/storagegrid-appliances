[.lead]
The SG5800 StorageGRID appliance is an integrated storage and computing platform that operates as a Storage Node in a StorageGRID grid.

StorageGRID SG5800 series appliance provides the following features:

* Integrate the storage and computing elements for a StorageGRID Storage Node.
* Include the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to simplify Storage Node deployment and configuration.
* Includes E-Series SANtricity System Manager for hardware management and monitoring.
* Support up to four 10-GbE or 25-GbE connections to the StorageGRID Grid Network and Client Network.
* Support Full Disk Encryption (FDE) drives or FIPS drives. When these drives are used with the Drive Security feature in SANtricity System Manager, unauthorized access to data is prevented.

The SG5800 appliance is available in two models: the SG5812 and the SG5860.

== SG5800 controller

Both the 12-drive SG5812 and the 60-drive SG5860 models of the StorageGRID appliance include an SG5800 compute controller and an E-Series E4000 storage controller. 


=== SG5800 compute controller

* Operates as the compute server for the appliance.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
+
NOTE: StorageGRID software is not preinstalled on the appliance. This software is accessed from the Admin Node when you deploy the appliance.

* Can connect to all three StorageGRID networks, including the Grid Network, the Admin Network, and the Client Network.
* Connects to the E4000 controller and operates as the initiator.
