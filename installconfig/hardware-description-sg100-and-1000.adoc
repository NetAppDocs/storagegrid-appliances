The StorageGRID SG100 services appliance and the SG1000 services appliance can operate as a Gateway Node and as an Admin Node to provide high availability load balancing services in a StorageGRID system. Both appliances can operate as Gateway Nodes and Admin Nodes (primary or non-primary) at the same time.

== Appliance features

Both models of the services appliance provide the following features:

* Gateway Node or Admin Node functions for a StorageGRID system.
* The StorageGRID Appliance Installer to simplify node deployment and configuration.
* When deployed, can access StorageGRID software from an existing Admin Node or from software downloaded to a local drive. To further simplify the deployment process, a recent version of the software is preloaded onto the appliance during manufacturing.
* A baseboard management controller (BMC) for monitoring and diagnosing some of the appliance hardware.
* The ability to connect to all three StorageGRID networks, including the Grid Network, the Admin Network, and the Client Network:
 ** The SG100 supports up to four 10- or 25-GbE connections to the Grid Network and Client Network.
 ** The SG1000 supports up to four 10-, 25-, 40-, or 100-GbE connections to the Grid Network and Client Network.

== SG100 and SG1000 diagrams

This figure shows the front of the SG100 and the SG1000 with the bezel removed. From the front, the two appliances are identical except for the product name on the bezel.

The two solid-state drives (SSDs), indicated by the orange outline, are used for storing the StorageGRID operating system and are mirrored using RAID 1 for redundancy. When the SG100 or SG1000 services appliance is configured as an Admin Node, these drives are used to store audit logs, metrics, and database tables.

The remaining drive slots are blank.

== SG100 and SG1000 applications

You can configure the StorageGRID services appliances in various ways to provide gateway services as well as redundancy of some grid administration services.

Appliances can be deployed in the following ways:

* Add to a new or existing grid as a Gateway Node
* Add to a new grid as a primary or non-primary Admin Node, or to an existing grid as a non-primary Admin Node
* Operate as a Gateway Node and Admin Node (primary or non-primary) at the same time

The appliance facilitates the use of high availability (HA) groups and intelligent load balancing for S3 or Swift data path connections.

The following examples describe how you can maximize the capabilities of the appliance:

* Use two SG100 or two SG1000 appliances to provide gateway services by configuring them as Gateway Nodes.
+
IMPORTANT: Don't deploy the SG100 and SG1000 service appliances in the same site. Unpredictable performance might result.

* Use two SG100 or two SG1000 appliances to provide redundancy of some grid administration services. Do this by configuring each appliance as Admin Nodes.
* Use two SG100 or two SG1000 appliances to provide highly available load balancing and traffic shaping services accessed through one or more virtual IP addresses. Do this by configuring the appliances as any combination of Admin Nodes or Gateway Nodes and adding both nodes to the same HA group.
+
IMPORTANT: If you use Admin Nodes and Gateway Nodes in the same HA group, Admin Node-only port will not fail over. See the instructions for https://review.docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118_main/admin/configure-high-availability-group.html[configuring HA groups^].

When used with StorageGRID storage appliances, both the SG100 and the SG1000 services appliances enable deployment of appliance-only grids with no dependencies on external hypervisors or compute hardware.
