When you install a SG5700 StorageGRID appliance, you connect the two controllers to each other and to the required networks. 

The figure shows the two controllers in the SG5760, with the E2800 controller on the top and the E5700SG controller on the bottom. In the SG5712, the E2800 controller is to the left of the E5700SG controller.
