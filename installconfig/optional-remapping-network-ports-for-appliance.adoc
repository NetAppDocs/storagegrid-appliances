You can optionally remap the internal ports on an appliance node to different external ports. For example, you might need to remap ports because of a firewall issue.

.Before you begin

You have previously accessed the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.

.About this task

You can't use remapped ports for load balancer endpoints. If you need to remove a remapped port, follow the steps in https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/maintain/removing-port-remaps.html[Remove port remaps^].

.Steps

. From the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, select *Configure Networking* > *Remap Ports*.
+
The Remap Port page appears.

. From the *Network* drop-down box, select the network for the port you want to remap: Grid, Admin, or Client.
. From the *Protocol* drop-down box, select the IP protocol: TCP or UDP.
. From the *Remap Direction* drop-down box, select which traffic direction you want to remap for this port: Inbound, Outbound, or Bi-directional.
. For *Original Port*, enter the number of the port you want to remap.
. For *Mapped-To Port*, enter the number of the port you want to use instead.
. Select *Add Rule*.
+
The new port mapping is added to the table, and the remapping takes effect immediately.

. To remove a port mapping, select the radio button for the rule you want to remove, and select *Remove Selected Rule*.
