You might need to replace an external Network Interface Card (NIC) in the SG6100-CN if it is not functioning optimally or if it has failed.

Use these procedures to: 

* Remove the NIC
* Reinstall the NIC

.Before you begin

* You have the correct replacement NIC.
* You have determined the link:verify-component-to-replace.html[location of the NIC to replace].
+

* You have link:locating-sgf6112-in-data-center.html[physically located the SG6100-CN controller] where you are replacing the NIC in the data center.
+
NOTE: Hot-swapping is *not* supported for this procedure. A link:power-sgf6112-off-on.html#shut-down-the-sgf6112-appliance[controlled shutdown of the appliance] is required before disconnecting cables and removing the NIC.

* You have disconnected all cables, including the two power cords on the SG6100-CN.
* *Optional*: You have removed the controller from the rack if required by local regulations. Removal is not required as the the NIC is externally accessible.


.About this task

To prevent service interruptions, confirm that all other Storage Nodes are connected to the grid before started the Network Interface Card (NIC) replacement or replace the NIC during a scheduled maintenance window when periods of service disruption are acceptable. See information about link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/monitor/monitoring-system-health.html#monitor-node-connection-states[montioring node connection states].

CAUTION: If you have ever used an ILM rule that creates only one copy of an object, you must replace the NIC during a scheduled maintenance window. Otherwise, you might temporarily lose access to those objects during this procedure. See information about link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/ilm/why-you-should-not-use-single-copy-replication.html[why you should not use single-copy replication].

== Remove the external NIC

.Steps

. Wrap the strap end of an ESD wristband around your wrist, and secure the clip end to a metal ground to prevent static discharge.
. Use a screwdriver to loosen the screw on the faceplate of the NIC.
