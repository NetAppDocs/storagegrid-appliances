:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
You might need to replace an E4000 controller  if it is not functioning optimally or if it has failed.

.Before you begin

* You have a replacement controller with the same part number as the controller you are replacing.
* You have labels to identify each cable that is connected to the controller.
* You have an ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* You have a #1 Phillips screwdriver.
* You have physically located the storage appliance where you are replacing the controller in the data center.

NOTE: Don't rely on the E-Series instructions to replace a controller in the StorageGRID appliance, because the procedures aren't the same.

.About this task

You can determine if you have a failed controller in two ways:

* The Recovery Guru in SANtricity System Manager directs you to replace the controller.
* The amber Attention LED on the controller is on, indicating that the controller has a fault.
+
NOTE: If both controllers in the shelf have their Attention LEDs on, contact technical support for assistance.

If your appliance contains two storage controllers, you can replace one of the controllers while your appliance is powered on and performing read/write operations, as long as the following conditions are true:

* The second controller in the shelf has Optimal status.
* The *OK to remove* field in the Details area of the Recovery Guru in SANtricity System Manager displays *Yes*, indicating that it is safe to remove this component.

NOTE: When possible, place the appliance into maintenance mode for this replacement procedure to minimize the potential impact of unforeseen errors or failures.

NOTE: If the second controller in the shelf does not have Optimal status or if the Recovery Guru indicates that it is not OK to remove the controller, contact technical support.


== Step 1: Prepare the replacement controller
Prepare the replacement E4000 controller.

.Steps
. Unpack the new controller, and set it on a flat, static-free surface.
+
Save the packing materials to use when shipping the failed controller.

. Locate the MAC address and FRU part number labels on the back of the replacement controller. 

== Step 2: Take the controller offline
Prepare to remove the failed controller and and take it offline.

.Steps

. Prepare to remove the controller. You use SANtricity System Manager to perform these steps.
+
.. Confirm that the replacement part number for the failed controller is the same as the FRU part number for the replacement controller.
+
When a controller has a fault and needs to be replaced, the replacement part number is displayed in the Details area of the Recovery Guru. If you need to find this number manually, you can look on the *Base* tab for the controller.
+
CAUTION: *Possible loss of data access &#8212;* If the two part numbers aren't the same, don't attempt this procedure.

.. Back up the configuration database.
+
If a problem occurs when you remove a controller, you can use the saved file to restore your configuration. The system will save the current state of the RAID configuration database, which includes all data for volume groups and disk pools on the controller.

... Select *Support › Support Center › Diagnostics*.
... Select *Collect Configuration Data*.
... Click *Collect*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name, *configurationData-<arrayName>-<dateTime>.7z*.

.. Collect support data for the appliance.
+
NOTE: Collecting support data before and after replacing a component ensures you can send a full set of logs to technical support if the replacement does not resolve the problem.
+
If a problem occurs when you remove a controller, you can use the saved file to troubleshoot the issue. The system will save inventory, status, and performance data about your storage array in a single file.

... *Select Support › Support Center › Diagnostics*.
... Select *Collect Support Data*.
... Click *Collect*.


== Step 3: Remove controller canister

Remove a controller canister.

.Steps

. Put on an ESD wristband or take other antistatic precautions.
. Label each cable that is attached to the controller canister.
. Disconnect all the cables from the controller canister.
+
CAUTION: To prevent degraded performance, do not twist, fold, pinch, or step on the cables.

. Squeeze the latch on the cam handle until it releases, open the cam handle fully to release the controller canister from the midplane, and then, using two hands, pull the controller canister out of the chassis.
. Place the controller on a flat, static-free surface with the removable cover facing up.
. Open the cover by pressing the blue buttons on the sides of the controller canister to release the cover, and then rotate the cover up and off of the controller canister.

== Step 4: Remove the battery

Removed the battery from the impaired controller and install it in the replacement controller.

.Steps

. Remove the battery from the controller canister:
.. Press the blue button on the side of the controller canister.
.. Slide the battery up until it clears the holding brackets, and then lift the battery out of the controller canister.
.. Unplug the battery plug by squeezing the clip on the face of the battery plug to release the plug from the socket, and then unplug the battery cable from the socket.

. Move the battery to the replacement controller canister and install it:
.. Align the battery with the holding brackets on the sheet metal side wall.
+
NOTE: Do not plug the battery in yet. You will plug it in once the rest of the components are moved to the replacement controller canister.



== Step 5: Move the DIMMs

Remove the DIMMs from the impaired controller canister and install them into the replacement controller canister.

.Steps

. Locate the DIMMs on your controller canister.
+
NOTE: Note the location of the DIMM in the sockets so that you can insert the DIMM in the same location in the replacement controller canister and in the proper orientation.
Remove the DIMMs from the impaired controller canister:

.. Eject the DIMM from its slot by slowly pushing apart the two DIMM ejector tabs on either side of the DIMM.
+
The DIMM will rotate up a little.

.. Rotate the DIMM as far as it will go, and then slide the DIMM out of the socket.
+
NOTE: Carefully hold the DIMM by the edges to avoid pressure on the components on the DIMM circuit board.
