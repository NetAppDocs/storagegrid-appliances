The SGF6112 appliance and SG6100-CN controller have eight cooling fans. If one of the fans fails, you must replace it as soon as possible to ensure that the appliance has proper cooling.

.Before you begin

* You have the correct replacement fan.
* You have link:verify-component-to-replace.html[determined the location of the fan to replace].
* You have link:locating-sgf6112-in-data-center.html[physically located the SGF6112 appliance or SG6100-CN controller] where you are replacing the fan in the data center.
+
NOTE: A link:power-sgf6112-off-on.html#shut-down-the-sgf6112-appliance-or-sg6100-cn-controller[controlled shutdown of the appliance] is required before removing the appliance from the rack.

* You have disconnected all cables and link:reinstalling-sgf6112-cover.html[removed the appliance cover].

* You have confirmed that the other fans are installed and running.

.About this task
To prevent service interruptions, confirm that all other Storage Nodes are connected to the grid before starting the fan replacement or replace the fan during a scheduled maintenance window when periods of service disruption are acceptable. See the information about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/monitor/monitoring-system-health.html#monitor-node-connection-states[monitoring node connection states^].

CAUTION: If you have ever used an ILM rule that creates only one copy of an object, you must replace the fan during a scheduled maintenance window because you might temporarily lose access to those objects during this procedure. See information about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/ilm/why-you-should-not-use-single-copy-replication.html[why you should not use single-copy replication^].

The appliance node will not be accessible while you replace the fan.

The image shows a fan for the appliance with the electrical connector highlighted. The cooling fans are accessible after you take the top cover off of the appliance.

NOTE: Each of the two power supply units also contain a fan. The power supply fans aren't included in this procedure.
