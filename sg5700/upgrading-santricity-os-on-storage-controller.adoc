To ensure optimal functioning of the storage controller, you must upgrade to the latest maintenance release of the SANtricity OS that is qualified for your StorageGRID appliance. 

Consult the https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT)^] to determine which version you should be using. 

Download the new SANtricity OS Software file from https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/storagegrid-appliance/downloads-tab[NetApp Downloads: StorageGRID Appliance^].

Use one of the following procedures based on the version of SANtricity OS currently installed:

* If the storage controller is using SANtricity OS 08.42.20.00 (11.42) or newer, use the Grid Manager to perform the upgrade.

* If the storage controller is using a SANtricity OS version older than 08.42.20.00 (11.42), use maintenance mode to perform the upgrade.
