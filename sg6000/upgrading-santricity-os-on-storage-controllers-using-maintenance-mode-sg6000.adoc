For storage controllers currently using SANtricity OS older than 08.42.20.00 (11.42), you must use the maintenance mode procedure to apply an upgrade.

.Before you begin

* You have consulted the https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT)^] to confirm that the SANtricity OS version you are using for the upgrade is compatible with your appliance.
* If the StorageGRID appliance is running in a StorageGRID system, you have placed the SG6000-CN controller into link:../commonhardware/placing-appliance-into-maintenance-mode.html[maintenance mode].
+
NOTE: Maintenance mode interrupts the connection to the storage controller.


.About this task

Don't upgrade the SANtricity OS or NVSRAM in the E-Series controller on more than one StorageGRID appliance at a time.

CAUTION: Upgrading more than one StorageGRID appliance at a time might cause data unavailability, depending on your deployment model and ILM policies.

.Steps

. Confirm that the appliance is in link:../commonhardware/placing-appliance-into-maintenance-mode.html[maintenance mode].

. From a service laptop, access SANtricity System Manager and sign in.
. Download the new SANtricity OS Software file and NVSRAM file to the management client.
+
CAUTION: The NVSRAM is specific to the StorageGRID appliance. Don't use the standard NVSRAM download.

. Follow the instructions in the _Upgrading SANtricity OS_ guide or the SANtricity System Manager online help to upgrade the firmware and NVSRAM.
+
NOTE: Activate the upgrade files immediately. Don't defer activation.

. If this procedure completed successfully and you have additional procedures to perform while the node is in maintenance mode, perform them now. When you are done, or if you experienced any failures and want to start over, select *Advanced* > *Reboot Controller*, and then select one of these options:

* Select *Reboot into StorageGRID*
* Select *Reboot into Maintenance Mode* to reboot the controller with the node remaining in maintenance mode.  Select this option if you experienced any failures during the procedure and want to start over.  After the node finishes rebooting into maintenance mode, restart from the appropriate step in the procedure that failed.

It can take up to 20 minutes for the appliance to reboot and rejoin the grid. To confirm that the reboot is complete and that the node has rejoined the grid, go back to the Grid Manager. The Nodes page should display a normal status (green check mark icon image:../media/icon_alert_green_checkmark.png[green check mark] to the left of the node name) for the appliance node, indicating that no alerts are active and the node is connected to the grid.
