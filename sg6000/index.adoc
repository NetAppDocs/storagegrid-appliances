You might need to perform maintenance procedures on the SG6000 appliance.

Procedures specific to maintaining your SG6000 appliance are in this section and assume that the appliance has already been deployed as a Storage Node in a StorageGRID system. 

See link:../commonhardware/index.html[Common procedures] for maintenance procedures that are used by all appliances. 

See link:../installconfig/configuring-hardware.html[Set up hardware] for maintenance procedures that are also performed during initial appliance installation and configuration.

To prevent service interruptions, confirm that all other Storage Nodes are connected to the grid before shutting down the appliance or shut down the appliance during a scheduled maintenance window when periods of service disruption are acceptable. See the information about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid/monitor/monitoring-system-health.html#monitor-node-connection-states[monitoring node connection states^].

CAUTION: If you have ever used an ILM rule that creates only one copy of an object, you must shut down the appliance during a scheduled maintenance window. Otherwise, you might temporarily lose access to those objects during any maintenance procedure that takes a storage node out of service. See the information about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid/ilm/index.html[managing objects with information lifecycle management^].
