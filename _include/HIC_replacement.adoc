//HIC replacement procedure for E2800 series controllers

== Step 5: Move HIC to new controller, if needed
If the failed controller includes a HIC, move the HIC from the failed controller to the replacement controller.

A separate HIC is used for the E2800B controller only. The HIC is mounted to the main controller board and includes two SPF connectors.  

NOTE: The illustrations in this procedure show a 2-port HIC. The HIC in your controller might have a different number of ports.
