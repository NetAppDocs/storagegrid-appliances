// Change network links for SGF6112, SG110, SG1100

.Before you begin

You have link:../commonhardware/placing-appliance-into-maintenance-mode.html[placed the appliance into maintenance mode]. 

NOTE: In rare instances, placing a StorageGRID appliance into maintenance mode might make the appliance unavailable for remote access.

.Steps

. From the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, select *Configure Networking* > *Link Configuration*.

. Make the desired changes to the link configuration.
+
For more information about the options, see link:../installconfig/configuring-network-links.html[Configure network links].
+
NOTE: IP configuration changes made while the appliance is in maintenance mode are not applied to the installed StorageGRID environment. Run the 
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid/maintain/changing-nodes-network-configuration.html[`change-ip` command] after rebooting the appliance into StorageGRID.

. When you are satisfied with your selections, click *Save*.
+
NOTE: You might lose your connection if you made changes to the network or link you are connected through. If you aren't reconnected within 1 minute, re-enter the URL for the StorageGRID Appliance Installer using one of the other IP addresses assigned to the appliance: `*https://_appliance_IP_:8443*`

. Make any necessary changes to the IP addresses for the appliance.
+
If you made changes to the VLAN settings, the subnet for the appliance might have changed. If you need to change the IP addresses for the appliance, see link:../installconfig/setting-ip-configuration.html[Configure StorageGRID IP addresses].

. Select *Configure Networking* > *Ping Test* from the menu.
. Use the Ping Test tool to check connectivity to IP addresses on any networks that might have been affected by the link configuration changes you made when configuring the appliance.
+
In addition to any other tests you choose to perform, confirm that you can ping the Grid Network IP address of the primary Admin Node, and the Grid Network IP address of at least one other node. If necessary, return to the instructions for configuring network links and correct any issues.

. After you are satisfied that your link configuration changes are working, reboot the node. From the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, select *Advanced* > *Reboot Controller*, and then select one of these options:
 ** Select *Reboot into StorageGRID* to reboot the compute controller with the node rejoining the grid. Select this option if you are done working in maintenance mode and are ready to return the node to normal operation.
 ** Select *Reboot into Maintenance Mode* to reboot the compute controller with the node remaining in maintenance mode. (This option is available only when the controller is in maintenance mode.) Select this option if there are additional maintenance operations you need to perform on the node before it rejoins the grid.
+
It can take up to 20 minutes for the appliance to reboot and rejoin the grid. To confirm that the reboot is complete and that the node has rejoined the grid, go back to the Grid Manager. The Nodes page should display a normal status (green check mark icon image:../media/icon_alert_green_checkmark.png["green check mark"]  to the left of the node name) for the appliance node, indicating that no alerts are active and the node is connected to the grid.
