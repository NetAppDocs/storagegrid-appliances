.About this task
To prevent service interruptions, confirm that all other Storage Nodes are connected to the grid before starting the fan replacement or replace the fan during a scheduled maintenance window when periods of service disruption are acceptable. See the information about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/monitor/monitoring-system-health.html#monitor-node-connection-states[monitoring node connection states^].

CAUTION: If you have ever used an ILM rule that creates only one copy of an object, you must replace the fan during a scheduled maintenance window. Otherwise, you might temporarily lose access to those objects during this procedure. See information about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/ilm/why-you-should-not-use-single-copy-replication.html[why you should not use single-copy replication^].

The appliance node will not be accessible while you replace the fan.

The photograph shows a fan for the appliance. The electrical connector is highlighted. The cooling fans are accessible after you take the top cover off of the appliance.

NOTE: Each of the two power supply units also contain a fan. The power supply fans aren't included in this procedure.
