// Replace NIC SGF6112, SG110, SG1100
// Intro and before you begin are in referencing topic

.About this task
To prevent service interruptions, confirm that all other Storage Nodes are connected to the grid before starting the Network Interface Card (NIC) replacement or replace the NIC during a scheduled maintenance window when periods of service disruption are acceptable. See the information about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/monitor/monitoring-system-health.html#monitor-node-connection-states[monitoring node connection states^].

CAUTION: If you have ever used an ILM rule that creates only one copy of an object, you must replace the NIC during a scheduled maintenance window. Otherwise, you might temporarily lose access to those objects during this procedure. See information about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/ilm/why-you-should-not-use-single-copy-replication.html[why you should not use single-copy replication^].

.Steps

. Wrap the strap end of the ESD wristband around your wrist, and secure the clip end to a metal ground to prevent static discharge.
. Locate the riser assembly that contains the NIC at the rear of the appliance.
+

The three NICs in the appliance are in two riser assemblies in the positions in the chassis shown in the photograph (Rear of appliance with top cover removed shown):

. Grasp the riser assembly with the failed NIC through the blue-marked holes and carefully lift it upwards. Move the riser assembly toward the front of the chassis as you lift it to allow the external connectors in its installed NICs to clear the chassis.
. Place the riser on a flat anti-static surface with the metal frame side down to access the NICs.

. Open the blue latch (circled) on the NIC to be replaced and carefully remove the NIC from the riser assembly. Rock the NIC slightly to help remove the NIC from its connector. Don't use excessive force.
. Place the NIC on a flat anti-static surface.

== Reinstall the internal NIC
Install the replacement NIC into the same location as the one that was removed.

.Before you begin

* You have the correct replacement NIC.
* You have removed the existing failed NIC.

.Steps

. Wrap the strap end of the ESD wristband around your wrist, and secure the clip end to a metal ground to prevent static discharge.
. Remove the replacement NIC from its packaging.

. If you are replacing one of the NICs in the two-slot riser assembly, do the following:
.. Ensure the blue latch is in the open position.
.. Align the NIC with its connector on the riser assembly. Carefully press the NIC into the connector until it is fully seated, as shown in the photograph, and then close the blue latch.

.. Locate the alignment hole on the two-slot riser assembly (circled) that aligns with a guide pin on the system board to ensure correct riser assembly positioning.

.. Position the riser assembly in the chassis, making sure that it aligns with the connector on the system board and guide pin. 

.. Carefully press the two-slot riser assembly in place along its center line, next to the blue-marked holes, until it is fully seated.

. If you are replacing the NIC in the one-slot riser assembly, do the following: 
.. Ensure the blue latch is in the open position.
.. Align the NIC with its connector on the riser assembly. Carefully press the NIC into the connector until it is fully seated as shown in the photograph and close the blue latch.
+

+
.. Locate the guide pin on the system board 
+
image::../media/sgf6112_one-slot-riser_system-pin.png[Guide pin on one-slot riser assembly]

.. Position the one-slot riser assembly in the chassis, making sure that it aligns with the connector on the system board and guide pin. 

.. Carefully press the one-slot riser assembly in place along its center line, next to the blue-marked holes, until it is fully seated.

. Remove the protective caps from the NIC ports where you will be reinstalling cables.

.After you finish

If you have no other maintenance procedures to perform in the appliance, reinstall the appliance cover, return the appliance to the rack, attach cables, and apply power.
