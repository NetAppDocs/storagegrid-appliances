NOTE: While the appliance is in maintenance mode, I/O (input/output) activity to the storage controller is stopped to make disruptive storage operations safe.

CAUTION: Don't upgrade the drive firmware on more than one StorageGRID appliance at a time. Doing so might cause data unavailability, depending on your deployment model and ILM policy.

.About this task

You can upgrade your appliance drive firmware using two methods: 

*Online*: The drives are upgraded one at a time while the appliance is performing I/O. This method does not require you to place the appliance in maintenance mode. However, system performance might be impacted and the upgrade might take several hours longer than the offline method. 

NOTE: Drives belonging to volumes that don't have redundancy must be updated using the offline method. The offline method should be used for any drive associated with flash read cache (for example, SSD drives in the SG6060), or any pool or volume group that is currently degraded. 

*Offline*: 
The drives are upgraded in parallel while the appliance is in maintenance mode. If the pool or volume group does not support redundancy or is degraded, you must use the offline method to upgrade the drive firmware. The offline method upgrades firmware only while all I/O activity is stopped on the drives to be upgraded. To stop I/O activity, place the node into maintenance mode.

The offline method is faster than the online method and will be significantly faster when many drives in a single appliance need upgrades. However, it requires that nodes be taken out of service, which might require scheduling a maintenance window and monitoring progress. Choose the method that is the best fit for your operational procedures and the number of drives that need to be upgraded.

CAUTION: There are two types of drives: SSD and HDD. You must use the offline method to upgrade the firmware on the SSDs (for example, SSD drives in the SG6060). You can use either the online or offline method to upgrade the firmware on HDDs.


.Steps

. If you are performing an offline upgrade, confirm that the appliance is in link:../commonhardware/placing-appliance-into-maintenance-mode.html[maintenance mode].
+
NOTE: If you are upgrading the firmware in SSD drives that are part of a cache group, you must ensure that no I/O is sent to any cached volumes while the upgrade is in progress. When the appliance is in maintenance mode, no I/O is sent to any volumes while the upgrade is in progress.

If any of the following errors occur during the upgrade procedure, take the appropriate recommended action.

 ** *Failed assigned drives*
+
One reason for the failure might be that the drive does not have the appropriate signature. Make sure that the affected drive is an authorized drive. Contact technical support for more information.
+
When replacing a drive, make sure that the replacement drive has a capacity equal to or greater than the failed drive you are replacing.

You can replace the failed drive while the storage array is receiving I/O.

 ** *Check storage array*
  *** Make sure that an IP address has been assigned to each controller.
  *** Make sure that all cables connected to the controller aren't damaged.
  *** Make sure that all cables are tightly connected.

 ** *Incomplete volume groups*

If one or more volume groups or disk pools are incomplete, you must correct this error condition before you can upgrade the firmware.

 ** *Exclusive operations (other than background media/parity scan) currently running on any volume groups*
