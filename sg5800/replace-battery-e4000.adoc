:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
You must replace the affected battery in your E4000 controller if Grid Manager issues an alert for a storage controller battery failure, or the Recovery Guru in SANtricity System Manager indicates a "Battery Failed" or "Battery Replacement Required" status. To protect your data, the battery must be replaced as soon as possible.

From SANtricity System Manager, review the details in the Recovery Guru to confirm that there is an issue with a battery and to ensure no other items must be addressed first.

.Before you begin

If you plan to replace a failed battery, you must have:

* A replacement battery.
* An ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* Labels to identify each cable that is connected to the controller canister.
* Access to SANtricity System Manager: 
** From Grid Manager, select *NODES* > *_appliance node_* > *SANtricity System Manager*. Controller information is on the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118/monitor/viewing-santricity-system-manager-tab.html[SANtricity System Manager tab].
** Point a browser in your management station to the controller's domain name or IP address.

== Step 1: Prepare to replace battery

Power down the controller shelf so you can safely remove the failed battery.

.Steps

. Back up the storage array’s configuration database using SANtricity System Manager.
+
If a problem occurs when you remove a controller, you can use the saved file to restore your configuration. The system will save the current state of the RAID configuration database, which includes all data for volume groups and disk pools on the controller.

** From System Manager:
.. Select *Support › Support Center › Diagnostics*.
.. Select *Collect Configuration Data*.
.. Click *Collect*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name, *configurationData-<arrayName>-<dateTime>.7z*.
** Alternatively, you can back up the configuration database by using the following CLI command:
+
`save storageArray dbmDatabase sourceLocation=onboard contentType=all file="filename";`
. Collect support data for your storage array using SANtricity System Manager.
+
If a problem occurs when you remove a controller, you can use the saved file to troubleshoot the issue. The system will save inventory, status, and performance data about your storage array in a single file.

.. Select *Support › Support Center › Diagnostics*.
.. Select *Collect Support Data*.
.. Click *Collect*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name, *support-data.7z*.
. Shut down the SG5800 controller.
.. Log in to the grid node:
... Enter the following command: `ssh admin@grid_node_IP`
... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
... Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
.. Shut down the SG5800 controller:
+
*`shutdown -h now`*
.. Wait for any data in cache memory to be written to the drives.
+
The green Cache Active LED on the back of the E4000 controller is on when cached data needs to be written to the drives. You must wait for this LED to turn off.
. From the home page of SANtricity System Manager, select *View Operations in Progress*.
. Confirm that all operations have completed before continuing with the next step.
. Turn off both power switches on the controller shelf.
. Wait for all LEDs on the controller shelf to turn off.


== Step 2: Remove E4000 controller canister

You need to remove the controller canister from the controller shelf, so you can remove the battery.

.Before you begin

Make sure you have the following:

* An ESD wristband, or you have taken other antistatic precautions.
* Labels to identify each cable that is connected to the controller canister.

.Steps

. Disconnect all the cables from the controller canister.
+
CAUTION: To prevent degraded performance, do not twist, fold, pinch, or step on the cables.

. If the host ports on the controller canister use SFP+ transceivers, leave them installed.
. Confirm that the Cache Active LED on the back of the controller is off.
. Squeeze the latch on the cam handle until it releases, open the cam handle fully to release the controller canister from the midplane, and then, using two hands, pull the controller canister half-way out of the chassis.


== Step 3: Install the new battery

You must remove the failed battery and replace it.

.Steps

. Unpack the new battery and place it on a flat, static-free surface.
+
NOTE: To comply with IATA safely regulations, replacement batteries are shipped with a state of charge (SoC) of 30 percent or less. When you reapply power, keep in mind that write caching will not resume until the replacement battery is fully charged and it has completed its initial learn cycle.
. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Remove the controller canister from the chassis.
. Turn the controller canister over and place it on a flat, stable surface.
. Open the cover by pressing the blue buttons on the sides of the controller canister to release the cover, and then rotate the cover up and off of the controller canister.
+

. Locate the battery in the controller canister.
. Remove the failed battery from the controller canister:
.. Press the blue button on the side of the controller canister.
.. Slide the battery up until it clears the holding brackets, and then lift the battery out of the controller canister.
.. Unplug the battery from the controller canister.

. Remove the replacement battery from its package. Install the replacement battery:
.. Plug the battery plug back into the socket on the controller canister.
+
Make sure that the plug locks down into the battery socket on the motherboard.
.. Align the battery with the holding brackets on the sheet metal side wall.
.. Slide the battery pack down until the battery latch engages and clicks into the opening on the side wall.
. Reinstall the controller canister cover and lock it into place.


== Step 4: Reinstall the controller canister

After you replace components in the controller canister, reinstall it into the chassis.

.Steps

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. If you have not already done so, replace the cover on the controller canister.
. Turn the controller canister over and align the end with the opening in the chassis.
. Align the end of the controller canister with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller canister halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller canister in the chassis until instructed to do so.
. Recable the system, as needed.
. Complete the reinstallation of the controller canister:
.. With the cam handle in the open position, firmly push the controller canister in until it meets the midplane and is fully seated, and then close the cam handle to the locked position.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller canister into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.
+
The controller begins to boot as soon as it is seated in the chassis.
.. If you have not already done so, reinstall the cable management device.
.. Bind the cables to the cable management device with the hook and loop strap.


== Step 5: Complete battery replacement

Power up the controller.

.Steps

. Turn on the two power switches at the back of the controller shelf.

** Do not turn off the power switches during the power-on process, which typically takes 90 seconds or less to complete.
** The fans in each shelf are very loud when they first start up. The loud noise during start-up is normal.

. When the controller is back online, check the controller shelf's Attention LEDs.
+
If the status is not Optimal or if any of the Attention LEDs are on, confirm that all cables are correctly seated, and check that the battery and the controller canister are installed correctly. If necessary, remove and reinstall the controller canister and the battery.
+
NOTE: If you cannot resolve the problem, contact technical support.
If needed, collect support data for your storage array using SANtricity System Manager.
. Collect support data for your storage array using SANtricity System Manager.
.. Select *Support › Support Center › Diagnostics*.
.. Select Collect Support Data.
.. Click Collect.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name, *support-data.7z*.

. Confirm that the reboot is complete and that the node has rejoined the grid. In the Grid Manager, verify that the *Nodes* page displays a normal status (green check mark to the left of the node name) for the appliance node, indicating that no alerts are active and the node is connected to the grid.  
+
NOTE: it may take 20 minutes from when you turn on the power switches to when the node rejoins the grid and displays a normal status in Grid Manager.”

.What's next?
Your battery replacement is complete. You can resume normal operations.
