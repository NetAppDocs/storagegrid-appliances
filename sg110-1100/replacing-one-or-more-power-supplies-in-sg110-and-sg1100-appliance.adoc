The SG110 and SG1100 appliances have two power supplies for redundancy. If one of the power supplies fails, you must replace it as soon as possible to ensure that the appliance has redundant power. Both power supplies operating in the appliance must be of the same model and wattage.

// Same procedure for SGF6112 - unable to use includes due to specific links in steps.

.Before you begin

* You have link:locating-sg110-and-sg1100-in-data-center.html[physically located the appliance] with the power supply to be replaced.

* You have link:verify-component-to-replace.html[determined the location of the power supply to replace].

* If you are replacing only one power supply:

** You have unpacked the replacement power supply unit and ensured that it is the same model and wattage as the power supply unit you are replacing. 

** You have confirmed that the other power supply is installed and running.

* If you are replacing both power supplies at the same time: 

** You have unpacked the replacement power supply units and ensured they are the same model and wattage.

IMPORTANT: If you have ever used an ILM rule that creates only one copy of an object and you are replacing both power supplies at the same time, you must replace the power supplies during a scheduled maintenance window. Otherwise, you might temporarily lose access to those objects during this procedure. See information about https://review.docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-118_main/ilm/why-you-should-not-use-single-copy-replication.html[why you should not use single-copy replication^].

. [[Unplug_the_power_cord, start=2]]Unplug the power cord from each power supply to be replaced.

When viewed from the rear of the appliance, power supply A (PSU0) is on the right and power supply B (PSU1) is on the left.
