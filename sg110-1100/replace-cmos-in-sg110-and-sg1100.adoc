Use this procedure to replace the CMOS coin cell battery on the system board.

Use these procedures to: 

* Remove the CMOS battery
* Reinstall the CMOS battery

== Remove the CMOS battery

.Before you begin

* You have link:verify-component-to-replace.html[verified the SG110 or SG1100 where the CMOS battery needs to be replaced].
* You have link:locating-sg110-and-sg1100-in-data-center.html[physically located the SG110 or SG1100 appliance] where you are replacing the CMOS battery in the data center.
* You have recorded the current BMC configurations of the appliance, if it remains available.
. Log in to the appliance to be replaced:
  .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
  .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
  .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
  .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Enter: `*run-host-command ipmitool lan print*` to display the current BMC configurations for the appliance.

NOTE: A link:power-sg110-and-sg1100-off-on.html#shut-down-the-sg110-or-sg1100-appliance[controlled shutdown of the appliance] is required before removing the appliance from the rack.

* You have disconnected all cables and link:reinstalling-sg110-and-sg1100-cover.html[removed the appliance cover].

.About this task
To prevent service interruptions, confirm that all other Storage Nodes are connected to the grid before starting the CMOS battery replacement or replace the battery during a scheduled maintenance window when periods of service disruption are acceptable. See the information about https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid/monitor/monitoring-system-health.html#monitor-node-connection-states[monitoring node connection states^].
